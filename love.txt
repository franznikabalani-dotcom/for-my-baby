    <h3>My Dearest Baby,</h3>

    <p>
    They say love is supposed to be simple, clean, and easy to explain.
    Ours never was—and yet it is the truest thing I’ve ever known.
    </p>

    <p>
    I used to be afraid of being judged, afraid of what the world would say
    about a girl loving another girl. But loving you, Baby, taught me that
    fear loses its power when love is honest.
    </p>

    <p>
    They can call it a mistake. They can call it a sin.
    But when you hold my hand, when you look at me the way you do,
    I feel more whole than I ever have.
    </p>

    <p>
    I don’t love you quietly.
    I love you boldly.
    I love you in a way that chooses you,
    even when the world doesn’t understand.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am yours—in the easy days
    and in the difficult ones too.
    As long as I can feel warmth and light,
    I will carry you with me.
    </p>

    <p>
    I love you, Baby.
    I will always make sure you know that.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Always, Yours ♡</strong></p>
